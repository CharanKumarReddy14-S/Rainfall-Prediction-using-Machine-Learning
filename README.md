# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts rainfall using historical weather data and supervised machine learning models. The goal is not to magically “forecast the weather” (that’s unrealistic without physics-based models), but to learn patterns from past data and produce probabilistic or numeric rainfall predictions.
